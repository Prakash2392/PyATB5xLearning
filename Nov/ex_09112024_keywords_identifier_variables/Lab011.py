# BODMAS rule
#
# The Bodmas rule states that division and multiplication must be done before addition
# and subtraction in any mathematical example. And if there are brackets (or parentheses)
# and orders (of powers or roots), these must be done first of all. For example in the
# question 47 + 54 ÷ 9 the answer is 53 not 11.2r.
# The Bodmas rule follows the order of the BODMAS acronym ie  B – Brackets,
# O – Order of powers or roots, D – Division, M – Multiplication A – Addition, and
# S – Subtraction. Mathematical expressions with multiple operators need to be solved
# from left to right in the order of BODMAS.
# Division and Multiplication are considered as interchangeable and depend on which comes
# first in the expression, as are Addition and Subtraction.
